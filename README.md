# 10 Days Stock Price Prediction for GOOGLE


# ABSTRACT

This thesis delves into the application of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models to predict Google (GOOG) stock prices, aiming to evaluate LSTM's efficacy in forecasting open and closed prices with an attained accuracy of 81.08%. Through a meticulous methodology encompassing data collection, LSTM model development, and thorough analysis, the study uncovers LSTM's ability to capture temporal dependencies within GOOG's historical data. However, observed limitations such as sensitivity to overfitting and market volatility caution against sole reliance on machine learning-based forecasts. The research sheds light on LSTM's potential as a supplementary tool for informed financial decision-making, urging continued refinement and validation while emphasizing the necessity of integrating machine learning forecasts with expert judgment for prudent decision-making in dynamic financial markets.

# SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

The comprehensive evaluation conducted in this chapter underscores the LSTM model's prowess in forecasting GOOG stock prices, yielding a noteworthy accuracy level of 81.08%. This achievement attests to the model's capability in approximating future price movements with a commendable degree of precision. However, a nuanced analysis delving into the model's performance on unseen data and the comparative study between predicted and actual prices reveals avenues for further refinement and validation in real-world scenarios.

While the model's accuracy is substantial, critical scrutiny reveals potential areas for enhancement. The exploration of the model's performance on unseen data unraveled nuances requiring attention, suggesting the need for continual refinement to bolster the model's adaptability across diverse market conditions. Additionally, while the model exhibited promise in approximating future price movements, the comparison between predicted and actual prices illuminated certain disparities, signaling the necessity for ongoing validation and fine-tuning to improve the model's accuracy further.

This chapter serves as a pivotal evaluation of the LSTM model's predictive capabilities, setting the stage for subsequent discussions and insights gleaned from empirical findings. The identified areas for refinement lay the groundwork for future endeavors aimed at fortifying the model's robustness and applicability in real-world financial forecasting scenarios, guiding the evolution of predictive models within the dynamic landscape of stock market predictions.
